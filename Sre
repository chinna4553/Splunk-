Here are SRE-specific questions derived from the repository provisioning workflow diagram:

Reliability and Monitoring

1. How would you ensure the reliability of the API during the repository provisioning process?


2. What metrics would you monitor to identify potential failures in the compliance control and permission check steps?


3. How can you ensure end-to-end observability for this workflow, including UI/UX, API, and approval stages?



Automation and Incident Management

4. How would you design alerting for failures at the "Parameter Verification" or "Control Permission Check" stages?


5. What strategies would you use to reduce manual approvals while ensuring compliance in the workflow?


6. How would you handle incidents arising from failed repository creations to ensure minimal impact on developer productivity?



Scalability and Performance

7. How would you scale the API to handle a high volume of concurrent repository creation requests?


8. What changes would you suggest to make this process more resilient during peak provisioning times?


9. How can you implement rate limiting to ensure fair usage of the API without impacting reliability?



Failure Recovery and Redundancy

10. What mechanisms would you implement to retry or recover from failures in the repo creation step?


11. How would you handle cascading failures in this workflow, ensuring no step causes system-wide downtime?


12. How can you ensure redundancy in the approval process to prevent single points of failure?



Compliance and Security

13. How would you ensure that compliance control checks are not a bottleneck in the provisioning process?


14. What SRE practices can help secure sensitive data, such as repository credentials, in this workflow?



Continuous Improvement

15. How can you apply chaos engineering to test the reliability of this provisioning workflow?


16. What post-mortem practices would you recommend after an incident to improve the provisioning system?


17. How would you implement Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for this workflow?



These questions focus on reliability, automation, scalability, security, and continuous improvementâ€”all core aspects of SRE. Let me know if you'd like to expand on any of these!
