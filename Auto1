Thanks for the clarification! Here's the revised version with that detail included, organized into clear paragraphs:

In the Automation Dashboard, I have added three new panels to provide better visibility into automation compliance and system readiness.

The first panel is Compliance Overview. It displays the status counts for categories such as "Not in Central Remit" and "Central Remit", along with N, N-1, and N-2 views. Additionally, this panel shows the percentage of N and N-1 individually, as well as their combined percentage. This gives a detailed insight into the compliance distribution across different time frames.

The second panel is the Network View. It presents network-related status counts in a similar format, with data grouped by N, N-1, and their respective percentages. Users can interact with the panel by clicking on the numbers to see detailed drill-downs, including specific server information related to each status.

The third panel is the Server Pre-Check View, which provides visibility into pre-check results of individual servers. It also follows the same format, showing counts and percentages for N and N-1, and allows users to click through to view detailed server-level information.

All three panels consistently highlight N and N-1 data, making it easy to compare current and previous cycle performance. These enhancements ensure that the dashboard provides an interactive, informative, and consistent view for compliance tracking and automation analysis.

Let me know if you'd like this version shortened or formatted for a specific audience.
