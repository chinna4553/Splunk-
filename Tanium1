This Splunk dashboard is designed for monitoring the status of Tanium clients in comparison with Otel agent installation and activity. It features four key filters—Time, Computer Name, Country, and Platform—allowing users to narrow down and analyze specific data sets. By default, the dashboard displays complete data without any filter applied. It provides detailed OS-wise (Windows and Linux) country-level breakdowns, making it easier to understand geographic distribution. Server-wise breakdowns show how many clients are connected to each Tanium server. Additional panels highlight the count of devices by Otel version and Otel installation status. A dedicated section named “Otel Agent Installed State” provides deeper insights into Otel deployment across environments. This section includes five pie charts: Windows/Linux country counts, individual OS country breakdowns, platform-wise distribution, and environment-wise summaries. These visuals help quickly assess coverage and identify gaps in Otel agent installation. A supporting table view lists detailed information on both Tanium client and Otel status for individual systems.
