I recently attended the Root Framework training, where I gained hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of its structure and implementation. As part of the training, I applied the concepts learned by writing test cases for two key portals:
	1.	ESM Service Centric Enrichment – I focused on creating test cases that validate the enrichment features and ensure the workflows function as expected based on service-centric design.
	2.	Self Service Portal – I developed test cases to validate the user interface and user experience, covering key functionalities like ticket submission, status tracking, and service request automation.

This practical exposure helped reinforce my understanding of the Root Framework and improved my testing skills by applying them to real-world scenarios within the enterprise service management domain.
