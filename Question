Your questions are clear but could be slightly refined for better grammar and clarity. Here's an improved version:

1. If there are any major changes made to the repository settings, how will the scanning process be performed to compare and validate these changes?


2. What type of data is stored in the repository, and are there any controls in place to validate the data during upload to Git?


3. What actions will be taken if a repository is not used for a long time?


4. If a repository's settings are changed, how will the criticality and impact of the changes be determined?



These rephrased questions are grammatically accurate and retain your intended meaning. Let me know if you need further assistance!
