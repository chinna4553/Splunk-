Here are some thoughtful questions you can ask the team about the "Code Control" flowchart from an SRE perspective:


---

General Understanding

1. What is the primary objective of this flowchart in the development lifecycle?


2. Who owns each stage of the process, and how do they collaborate?




---

Pull Requests and Conflict Management

3. What measures are in place to detect and resolve merge conflicts automatically?


4. How are developers notified about merge conflicts, and what is the expected resolution time?




---

Pipeline Automation

5. What triggers the CI Pipeline—only pull requests or other events as well?


6. How long does each step of the pipeline typically take, and are there any bottlenecks?


7. Is the pipeline designed to handle multiple pull requests simultaneously?




---

Code Quality Checks

8. What rules are used for linting, and how customizable are they for different projects?


9. Which vulnerabilities are prioritized in the SAST (SonarQube) step, and how often are the rules updated?


10. What actions are taken if vulnerabilities are found in third-party libraries during the dependency scan?




---

Testing and Coverage

11. What criteria determine whether unit tests are sufficient to proceed?


12. How is the code coverage report evaluated, and what is the minimum acceptable threshold?


13. Are integration tests or end-to-end tests considered in this pipeline?




---

Compliance and Credential Checks

14. What specific compliance policies are being checked in the compliance step?


15. How are credentials detected in the code, and what steps are taken to remediate such issues?




---

Notifications and Approvals

16. How are developers notified about failed steps, and what is the feedback mechanism?


17. Who is responsible for granting approvals, and is this process automated?


18. Is there an escalation process if approvals are delayed or denied?




---

Security and Monitoring

19. How is security ensured throughout the pipeline, especially during SAST and dependency scans?


20. Are there any monitoring tools in place to track the pipeline's performance and reliability?




---

Scalability and Enhancements

21. Can this process handle an increase in the number of pull requests as the team scales?


22. What future enhancements are planned for this pipeline (e.g., adding dynamic security testing)?


23. How does this pipeline integrate with external tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps?




---

Incident Handling

24. What steps are followed if the pipeline itself fails or encounters errors?


25. How are pipeline logs stored and analyzed to ensure quick troubleshooting?
