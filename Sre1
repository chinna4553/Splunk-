Based on the Repo Control & Lifecycle Management diagram, here are SRE-specific questions that align with its flow:

Observability and Monitoring

1. What key metrics would you monitor to ensure baseline initialization and regular scans are functioning correctly?


2. How would you implement observability to detect deviations between the current state and the baseline store?


3. What tools would you recommend to log and analyze configuration changes and compare results?



Automation and Rollbacks

4. How can you automate the comparison process to minimize manual intervention and reduce errors?


5. What strategies would you use to ensure the success of automatic rollbacks in critical scenarios?


6. How would you manage the approval process for offline rollbacks to balance speed and reliability?



Failure Detection and Recovery

7. What mechanisms can be implemented to detect high-impact configuration issues before they affect production?


8. How would you design alerts to notify developers about configuration deviations or rollback actions?


9. How can you ensure that the remediation process after a rollback is seamless and minimizes downtime?



Compliance and Auditing

10. What methods would you use to ensure compliance with the regular audit process shown in the diagram?


11. How can you ensure the integrity of the baseline store, especially during frequent updates?


12. What strategies would you implement to track and report the outcomes of regular scans and audits?



Scalability and Reliability

13. How would you scale the system to manage a growing number of repositories while maintaining consistent control?


14. What steps can you take to ensure that the webhook of configuration changes remains reliable under heavy loads?


15. How would you design the system to handle false positives or non-critical deviations efficiently?



Continuous Improvement

16. How can you use chaos engineering practices to test the reliability of this repo control system?


17. What SRE techniques would you recommend to continuously optimize the lifecycle management process?


18. How would you implement Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for this workflow, and what should be the primary SLIs?



These questions focus on the reliability, automation, compliance, and continuous improvement aspects crucial to SRE practices. Let me know if you'd like to explore any area in more detail!
