Hereâ€™s a properly structured and clear version of your description in paragraph form:

The "Otel Agent Status" dashboard is used to monitor the status of the Otel agent across various systems. It includes filters such as Platform, Time, Hostname, and Service Name, and all panels dynamically update based on the selected filters. By default, the dashboard displays data for all platforms, including both Linux and Windows. Multiple panels provide different breakdowns of Otel-related metrics. The Otel Version panel shows the count of systems grouped by Otel version. The Otel Install Status panel displays the installation status of the Otel agent. The Otel Service Status panel shows the status of the Otel service across systems. The Endpoint URL panel provides counts based on different endpoint URLs being used. The Validate Otel Config panel highlights the status of configuration validation. The Port Connection panel shows the count of systems based on active port connections. Additional panels display counts by Environment, OS Version, and also by Country, showing a breakdown of Otel Install Status and Service Status. A detailed table is also included at the bottom, presenting a comprehensive view of Otel agent data with fields like Hostname, Service Name, and other related attributes.

Let me know if you want this more formal or need it split into bullet points.
