In the GBGF Dashboard, I have added additional filters to enhance data customization and analysis. The new filters include Risk, isSkipPatch, isOnHold, and Lifecycle. I have also introduced a new panel named GBGF Org6 Risk View, which presents a table view of risk status at the Org6 level. This panel displays the count of servers categorized as High Risk, Low Risk, and No Risk. Additionally, the panel is interactiveâ€”clicking on any number allows users to drill down and view detailed server-level information. These updates provide more flexibility and clarity for analyzing risk across organizational levels.
