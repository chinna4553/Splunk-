Sure! Here's a clear and structured paragraph summarizing your work on the HIC Dashboard:


---

I have created the HIC Dashboard to provide detailed middleware insights. In this dashboard, I added several panels to display key metrics, including Total Build Request Ansible Count, Success Request Count, Failed Request Count, and Progress/Started Count. These panels help track the status and outcomes of Ansible build requests. Additionally, I created a detailed table view that includes multiple fields such as Hostname, Correlation ID, and other relevant data for deeper analysis. To support these views, I also developed saved searches focused on Middleware, Database, and Operating System components. These enhancements ensure efficient tracking and monitoring of build processes across different layers.

Let me know if you'd like it formatted for documentation or stakeholder reporting.
