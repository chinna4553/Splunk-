The diagram illustrates a Repo Provisioning process, which seems to automate repository creation based on defined parameters and checks. To prepare for a call with the application source code team, here are some meaningful questions you can ask:

Understanding the Process

1. Step Clarifications:

Could you explain the exact role of the "UI/UX" component? Is it a web interface for developers to submit requests?

What types of "Parameters" are verified during the Parameter Verification step?



2. Control and Permissions:

What permissions are checked in the Control Permission Check step? Are there specific roles or teams defined for repository creation?

What happens if compliance checks fail? Are these logged for further review?



3. Approvals Process:

Can you explain the circumstances under which the Approvals step is triggered?

Are these approvals automated, or do they involve manual intervention?




Technical Integration

4. API Interactions:

What APIs are involved in the Repo API step? Are they GitHub or other custom APIs?

Is there any feedback loop for API failures or success confirmations?



5. Default Settings:

What are the default configurations (branch protection, README, LICENSE) applied to new repositories? Can they be customized?



6. Failure Handling:

How are failures managed (e.g., retries, escalation)?

Is there a logging mechanism for troubleshooting failed requests?




SRE-Related Questions

7. Monitoring:

What monitoring tools are in place for this process? How do we ensure it runs smoothly?

Are there alerts for bottlenecks or unexpected failures?



8. Scalability:

How scalable is this process? Can it handle multiple requests simultaneously?



9. Incident Management:

How are incidents or errors reported and resolved during repo provisioning?



10. Change Requests:

If thereâ€™s a need to update the workflow (e.g., add extra checks or features), what is the process for making these changes?




Would you like me to tailor these questions further based on your team's focus or concerns?
