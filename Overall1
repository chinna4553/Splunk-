Sure! Here's the full update written as a clear and professional paragraph:


---

I have updated the Compliance Dashboard as per the latest requirements. Several existing panels have been removed to align with the new specifications. A new panel has been added to show the count of the difference between the lifecycle and isSkipRobot values, grouped specifically by the GR Collection Group. Additionally, I have removed the HRC Country filter, as it is no longer needed. The AD Group filter has also been removed from the dashboard. These updates ensure that the dashboard now reflects the most relevant and accurate compliance data.

Let me know if you want it in a more formal or technical tone.
