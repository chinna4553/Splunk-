Sure! Here's a polished version of your sentence:

"I made some updates to the Automation Telemetry Splunk dashboard by adding a region filter. Additionally, I linked the 'Total Number of Success Count' panel to another dashboardâ€”when you click on the count, it opens a detailed view showing server-specific information such as Server Name, Org6, Org7, OTG8, and Automation Name."

Let me know if you want it more formal or more casual.
